# A shell script to generate CMake/C++ projects

## CAVEAT
Quite old... I now use Bazel. Mayebe you can have a look [here](https://github.com/vincent-picaud/Bazel_and_CompileCommands)

## Old post
It is boring, error prone and time consuming to create a new *CMake*
build solution for each new C++ project.  The aim of this *shell
script* is to provide a working (at least I hope so) *project
skeleton* in one command line:

```
sh createProject.sh myProject
```

It also supports **super-project** creation.

See [documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/vincent-picaud/CMakeScript/blob/master/cmakeScript.html).

Any comment, feed back are welcome,
