# A shell script to generate CMake/C++ projects

**CMake** is a great tool, however despite all its advantages it is sometimes boring to create a new build solution for each new C++ project.
The aim of these **shell scripts** is to provide a working (at least I hope so) project skeleton in one command line.

```
sh createProject.sh myProject
```

It also supports **super-project** creation.

See [documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/vincent-picaud/CMakeScript/blob/master/cmakeScript.html).

Any comment, feed back are welcome,
